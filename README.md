# churn_prediction
## The mission : 

An important financial institution is interested in analyzing its client database to increase the revenue generated from credit cardholders. They are concerned about customers closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions.

The churn rate is above 15% and increasing, the CEO urges the marketing team to start a marketing campaign for client retention.

**What is Churn Rate ?**

*The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period.*

## **Data Engineer part :** 

### **CSV to DB**
The first step of the project is to obtain the data from this Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers) . The data will then be transformed and loaded into a relational database for further analysis.

### **Deployment** 

Here are the steps that were performed for the deployment :
* Develop a website featuring a form that enables users to make predictions using the model. In addition, allocate space for the dashboard that will be provided by my data analyst.
* Generate a Dockerfile to facilitate the creation of a Docker image for deployment on Render.com. Please note that creating the Docker image is intended for local testing purposes to ensure that the website functions as expected before deployment on Render.com.
* Integrate the functionalities developed by the ML engineer, including the prediction model and the dashboard from the data analyst, into the website.
* Perform thorough testing on the Docker image to ensure that all requirements are met, the prediction model functions correctly, and that the dashboard updates automatically.
* Now that everything work we can deploy on render.com !
