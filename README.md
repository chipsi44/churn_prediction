## The mission : 

An important financial institution is interested in analyzing its client database to increase the revenue generated from credit cardholders. They are concerned about customers closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions.

The churn rate is above 15% and increasing, the CEO urges the marketing team to start a marketing campaign for client retention.

**What is Churn Rate ?**

*The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period.*
